    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve the vocabulary of a FHIR server: With the vocabulary command, fq fetches and summarizes the key data elements (CodeableConcepts and Extensions) used within the FHIR data. This creates a central vocabulary Dataframe that helps researchers identify important data elements and their usage within the server.\n",
    "\n",

    "The jq utility is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It's like a Swiss Army knife for working with JSON data, and it is used here to help organize the responses from the FHIR server in a readable way."
